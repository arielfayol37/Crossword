# Fonts Directory

This directory should contain the OpenSans-Regular.ttf font file for the crossword generator to create image outputs.

## Getting the Font

You can download the Open Sans font from Google Fonts:
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans

Download the "Open Sans Regular" font and place the `OpenSans-Regular.ttf` file in this directory.

## Alternative

If you don't have the Open Sans font, you can modify the `generate.py` file to use a different font that's available on your system, or use a default system font by changing the font path in the `save()` method.
